## Learning Objectives

This exercise will allow you to get some experience working with variables, functions, control flow, iteration, and complex problem solving.

## Your Mission

The goal of the game is to move the ship around and avoid the asteroids as long as possible. Your mission is to code the rest of the game.

**What has been done for you**  
* All of the HTML and CSS is complete, you **must not change those**!
* The JavaScript to create the asteroids and fling them around is done (`asteroid-setup.js`).
* There is a function in the main `game.js` file for determining movement based on velocity and angle of the ship (`getShipMovement(shipVelocity, shipAngle)`).
  * This function returns an object with two properties (`top` and `left`) which represent the required _changes_ in the `top` and `left` css position for the ship.
* There is a function in the main `game.js` file that handles the majority of the actions needed when a crash occurs (`crash(asteroidElementThatWasHit)`).

You can find all of this code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tiy-dc-wdcp-jun-17/asteroids).

**What you must do**  
* Create a `ship` object that contains the HTML element and keeps track of the velocity and angle
* Implement the functionality to handle when keys are pressed:
  * When the up key is pressed, velocity increases
  * When the down key is pressed, velocity decreases (but not below zero)
  * When the right key is pressed, angle increases
      * Don't forget to rotate the ship at the same time! You can assign a CSS property in JavaScript using the HTML element object. All elements have a `style` property which is also an object. You can then assigned the `transform` property of the `style` object (the value would be `rotate(Xdeg)` value - replacing "X" with the current angle). For example: `someElement.style.transform = 'rotate(25deg)';`
  * When the left key is pressed, angle decreases
      * (_Same note as when the angle increases!_)
* In the game loop...
  * Move the ship according to the `getShipMovement(...)` function (see above)
      * You'll need to adjust the `top` and `left` style properties USING JAVASCRIPT (not in the CSS file).
      * When you get the existing `top` and `left` values from that `style` object on the element you'll need to convert it to a number, but the `Number()` function won't work since the string has `px` in it (for example, `"149px"`). Instead, use `parseInt(theString, 10)` to extract the integer number value from the string.
  * Check for any collisions with asteroids (using the `checkForCollisions()` function which **you must implement**!)
  * If a collision has occurred, call the `crash(asteroidHit)` function with the asteroid element that was hit

Other considerations...  
  * If a `crash` event occurs... what should your game do?
  * How will you be able to loop through all asteroids to check for collisions? Where will you get the list of asteroids from?

## EPIC Mode

Make the ship "wrap" from one edge of the screen to the other.
